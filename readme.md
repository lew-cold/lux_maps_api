# Lux Group - Luxury Escapes - Maps API challenge

Live Version: http://theyorkshirecoder.com/lux_maps_api/


## The Brief

The aim of the challenge is to digest the [Luxury Escapes public API](https://api.luxgroup.com/api/public-offers) to plot the featured offerings on a map.

### Guidelines

* You should be able to work out API usage from viewing traffic from luxuryescapes.com
* Requirements are intended to be loose - initiative should form the basis of the approach.
* Additional points are awarded for next/back paging buttons
